### About this website...

In just over a hundred years, commercial aviation has achieved the incredible feat of connecting almost any two locations on Earth in an affordable, fast, and safe manner. By physically connecting people across continents, it has shaped an entire cosmopolitan culture, formed unlikely friendships and romances, and fulfilled personal and professional ambitions. It has also enabled global commerce and trade-based diplomacy, ushering the world into an unprecedented era of peace and shared prosperity.

The aviation industry accomplished all this by scaling up the complex manufacturing and operation of heavier-than-air engineering marvels, while achieving six-to-seven sigmas of quality and safety.

Achievements aside, however, it is also an industry rife with internal and external paradoxes.

Internally, airlines enable value for others but struggle to be profitable themselves. Risk-averse attitudes favor safety but also hinder product and process innovation, leading to outdated designs and business practices. Aircraft are designed to be resilient, but airports and airlines remain vulnerable to the slightest operational and economic disruption.

Externally, and despite its democratization, air transport remains in reach of only a narrow customer base, estimated between 10% and 20% of all living humans. Yet, the industry imposes its negative externalities, in the form of greenhouse gas emissions and attendant climate change, on everyone. And while regulations have eventually resulted in safe operations, they have also been written in blood.

Going forward, the inflating costs of materials and regulatory compliance, the inclusion of climate externalities in the ticket price, and an increased environmental awareness among the traveling public may trigger the onset of "peak (affordable) flying". Beyond that, the future may entail a shrinking passenger headcount, more purposeful travel, diseconomies of scale, and radical changes to today's business models.

Through this website, I intend to reflect on the present state and plausible futures of aviation, as well as the adjacent aerospace, travel, and cargo and logistics industries. My thoughts are rooted in over two decades of relevant professional experience, years of academic research, and a keen interest in the topic. This website is not affiliated with any of my present or previous organizations, and the views expressed here are solely my own.

### About the author

Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. My name is Thomas D. Pellegrin. I am a professional aerospace and aviation consultant, academic researcher, and regular speaker at industry events. I also hold a private pilot license.

As an industry consultant since 2000, I have advised governments, aircraft manufacturers, airlines, airports, civil aviation authorities, maintenance organizations, and air navigation service providers on turning their business strategy into safe, efficient, sustainable, and profitable operations. I have worked with clients in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Oceania. Since 2018, I have been leading the Asia consulting practice of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Before that, I led PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)'s aviation consulting practice in the Middle East, and founded PwC's Global Aviation Center of Excellence, a worldwide nexus of ~650 like-minded professionals with sectoral expertise.

As an academic researcher, I am at the all-but-dissertation stage of a Ph.D. in Aviation program with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. My doctoral research focuses on simulating the economic impacts of climate change on takeoff performance. Beyond this niche topic, I am interested in the reciprocal interplay between climate change and air transport, and the resulting decarbonization and adaptation measures necessary to ensure a sustainable future for air travel.

As a regular speaker at industry events, I have presented original thought leadership at many conferences over the years, including most recently the IATA World Cargo Symposium in Singapore, the Global Airport Development (GAD) Asia Conference in Goa, the Smart Airport Technovation Conference in Hong Kong, and the AviAsian Conference in Singapore.

### Contact and engagement

As an aerospace, aviation, travel, and logistics subjet matter expert, I am available for:

- Joining a corporate or non-profit Board, think tank, or expert panel;
- Producing original and data-driven research, incl. contributing to academic papers as a second author;
- Presenting keynotes and moderating panels at your industry or corporate event;
- Participating in media interviews and publications as a subject matter expert.
- The themes that I am most comfortable addressing include business strategy and competition, operational strategy, product and service innovation, technology, and sustainability (incl. both the effects of aviation on climate change, and of climate change on aviation). I enjoy providing a big-picture, long-term view of industry issues, and drawing from innovative concepts outside of the industry to provoke the audience into thinking laterally about the challenges at hand.

I am bilingual in English and French. I am proficient in using R (incl. data.tables, ggplot2, etc.) for data analytics, research, and visualization.

I am based in Singapore and can travel.
